# pylily-music
Python code to generate music (mostly patterns for exercises) with output in lilypond

The core code is in lilypy/scale, /mode, and /chord.  They contain the functions scale, mode, and chord, respectively.  They could be turned into methods of a class (like a Note class) where the output of the functions is a list of Notes.

lilypy/note is in early development (not working).
